**Background** 

LionsMatter is a service where students can publically express their concerns, comments, and suggestions. These posts can then be voted and commented on by other students, helping the College to better gauge where its attention and priorities should be. This system goes one step further than most; instead of leaving posts to sit and fade into obscurity, they are instead delegated to specific College departments in a weekly email known as the "LionsMatter Weekly Rundown".  (Quoted from original site)


**Features** 

* Students are authenticated via their school emails or the school's authentication system.
* Administrators can respond to student posts as super users with their own backend interface and dashboard.
