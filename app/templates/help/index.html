                    	The option to post anonymously is always available on both posts and comments. While anonymous posts and comments WILL NOT link to your profile, they will be visible on your profile. You can find more information on setting your "post as" name to anonymous on this page in the <a href="#postas">Setting your "Post as" Name</a> section.

                    <div class="col-sm-12">
                    	You can submit posts from any of the feeds pages or your own profile. In order to submit a post you must set the department feed you want to post to. The only exception to this is when you are viewing a specific department's feed (in this case the department will be set to the feed you are viewing by default, though you may still change which department you post to). You can set the department feed you are posting to by selecting one from the department dropdown next to the submit button. You WILL NOT be able to submit a post until a department has been selected.

                        <i>NOTE: If you need help deciding which department feed you should submit a post to, please consult the Feeds section of the About page, located <a href="http://lionsmatter.com/about#feeds">here</a>.</i>

                    	You can set your "post as" name for all of your comments and posts. Your post as name is the name that gets attached to your comments and posts. The options for post as names include your full name, your unix username, and "anonymous". No matter which post as name you choose, all of you comments and posts will appear on your profile.
                        <br/><br/>
                        You can set your default "post as" name on the <a href="http://www.lionsmatter.com/settings">settings</a> page under the privacy section. Your default post as name is the name that will appear on your posts and comments by default. You can change your post as name on a case by case basis when you post and comment as well. To do this, click the post as button (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span>) and select the appropriate name. The name you are using to post will appear at the top of the open post as dropdown.
